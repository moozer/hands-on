Warning: Working with PAM may lock you out of your system. Use a test machine untill you are sure and/or keep a backup root terminal open.

1. Read up om [PAM](http://www.linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/Linux-PAM_SAG.html)

    This is the "pluggable authentication module". IT is used for all things about logging in.

2. Set a complexity rule for passwords

    We use pam_pwquality for this. Go [here](https://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=Ubuntu_16.04&p=password) for guide

    * Use at least two groups
    * Password complexity must be a least 20


3. Set timeout

    This is done in /etc/login.defs

    * Set timeout to 7 days
    * Set a warning time or 14 days.

    Note that this only work on newly created accounts.

4. As root, Run `adduser newuser`

    This creates a new account

5. As root, run `chage --list newuser`

    to see the expiry date.

6. Log in as newuser

    you should see the expiry warning

7. Implement 2 factor authentication using google authenticator
