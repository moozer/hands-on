This is a tour of some SSH features. Especially the part about passwordless login, if highly useful.

We will assume that your usernam is `user`, and substitute `Deb01` and `Deb02` with their respective IP adresses. The interface for the internet connection is `eth0`

### Setting up passwordless login

1. Spinup two debian machines. Call them Deb01 and Deb02.

2. On both Deb01 and Deb02, run `/sbin/ifconfig eth0`

    Make a note of the IP adresses.

2. On both Deb01 and Deb02, run `ss -antp | grep LISTEN | grep 22`

    You should see that a service is running, perhaps on both ipv4 and ivp6.

3. On Deb01, run `ssh Deb02`

    Type your password as promptet.

4. Type `exit`

    to return to Deb01

5. On Deb01, follow [this guide](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/11/3-steps-to-perform-ssh-login-without-password-using-ssh-keygen-ssh-copy-id)

    to generate and copy your keys to Deb02

6. On Deb01, run `ssh Deb02`

    to check that you can SSh to the remote machine without password


### Make an encrypted tunnel

1. On Deb02 as root, run `apt-get install lighttpd`

    This installs a minimal webserver

2. On Deb01, start a browser and go to [http://Deb02/](http://Deb02/)

    to check that it worked

3. Start wireshark and see the HTTP trafic

4. On Deb01, run `ssh -L 10080:Deb02:80 Deb02 -N`

    to start the tunnel

2. On Deb01, start a browser and go to [http://Deb02:10080](http://Deb02:10080)

    to check that it worked

3. On Deb01, start wireshark and see the trafic

    You should see SSH trafic and no HTTP trafic

4. On Deb02, start wireshark and see localhost trafic

    You should now see the HTTP trafic


### Using a jump host
You need a third device for this. Either spin up a third debian machine, or use another device that you ahve ssh access to. We call this device Deb03.

1. On both Deb01 and Deb02, run `ssh Deb03`

    to ensure that you are able to connect to it.

2. On Deb02, run `ssh -A -o 'ProxyCommand=ssh -W %h:%p Deb02' Deb03`

    to connect to Deb03 through Deb02 using the keys on Deb01.

3. On Deb02, run `netstat -antp`

    to see that Deb01 has connected to Deb02 and that Deb02 has connected to Deb03.
