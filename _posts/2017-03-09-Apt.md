This is a tour of some apt concept, and how to configure unattended-upgrades (i.e. background installation of packages) on Debian.

2. Spin up an debian machine

3. As non-root, Run `apt-cache policy`

    and understand the concept of priorities and repository

    See `man apt_preferences` for the details

4. As root, run `apt-get update`

    to update package list from all repositories.

5. Run `apt-cache policy linux-image-amd64`

    as an example to see the available linux kernels.

6. Install unattended upgrades as described [here](https://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades)

    use the version with “20auto-upgrades”

    set the origins-pattern to
    > Unattended-Upgrade::Origins-Pattern {
    >
    > "o=${distro_id},n=${distro_codename},l=${distro_id}-Security";
    >
    > "o=${distro_id},n=${distro_codename}-updates,l=${distro_id}";
    >
    > };
    >

7. Run `unattended-upgrade --dry-run –verbose`

    to check that it works

8. Check that it works by looking in the logs

    They are located in `/var/log`

9. Run `unattended-upgrade –verbose`

    to do the upgrade

10. Run `apt-get upgrade`

    to upgrade any other package that were not in the unattended upgrades “origins-pattern”
